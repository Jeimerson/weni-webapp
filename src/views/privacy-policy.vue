          <br />
          Weni Flows: It consists of a free open source framework designed to
          send and receive data using basic mobile phones, manage complex
          workflows, automate analysis, and present data in real time.
          <br /><br />
          API: The acronym stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a
          set of routines and programming standards for accessing a software
          application or web-based platform.
          <br /><br />
          USER: It is you, the company, Non-Governmental Organization, Civil
          Association, which has been invited to use the Weni Flows through Weni
          and manages it, in accordance with the conditions established in this
          term, to create automated communication flows with its
          customers.CLIENTS: It is the customers or interviewed by the user,
          individual or legal, who received messages through the Weni Flows.
          <br /><br />
          CHANNELS: This is where the interaction between a person and the bot
          (robot) takes place. That occurs from the creation of the flow by you.
          Thus, it consists of the means by which the messages are delivered to
          the customer. Through channel management, you can conduct campaigns
          and, therefore, collect data for desired purposes. Weni Flows
          currently supports the WhatsApp channel.
          <br /><br />
          MESSAGES: The data that travels through the channels.
          <br /><br />
          FLOWS: These are interactive ways to show how information is
          disseminated or how data is collected. Visual and intuitive flow
          creation allows you to precisely define which messages are exchanged
          with customers.
          <br /><br />
          CAMPAIGNS: Tool within the platform that make it possible for you to
          have continuous contact with customers, automating the periodicity of
          the system to contact them again to send new information, collect new
          data or check if a given situation has changed.
          <br /><br />
          TRIGGERS: Enable the system to react to external stimuli, and can
          determine how the system responds by receiving a textual message
          through a channel.
          <br /><br />
          ANALYTICS: It is the portal of analysis of the platform, being able to
          visualize information on the number of messages, categories and users.
          <br /><br />

          via API with Weni Flows that allows you to send usage time credit to
          more than 400
          <br /><br />
          operators in more than 100 countries. This requires a Transfer to
          account.
          <br /><br />

          your prior authorization.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>2.2 DATA EXCLUSION</b><br />
          All data collected, including your personal information, will be
          excluded from our servers when you request it or when it is no longer
          necessary or relevant to offer you our services, unless there is any
          other reason for its maintenance, as a legal obligation of retention
          of data or the need to preserve them for the protection of Weni Flows
          rights.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>2.3 MONITORING</b><br />
          Weni reserves the right to monitor all the platform, mainly to ensure
          that the rules outlined in our Terms of Use are being observed, or if
          there is no violation or abuse of the applicable laws.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>3. INFORMATION SHARING</b><br />
          Weni reserves the right to provide their data and information about
          you, including your interactions, if requested to do so legally, must
          act so that the company complies with national laws, or if you
          expressly authorized.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>4. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</b><br />
          All your data is confidential and only the people with the necessary
          permissions will have access to it. Any use of these will be in
          accordance with this Policy. Weni Flows will make reasonable efforts
          to ensure the security of our systems and data. Our servers are
          located in different locations to ensure stability and security, and
          can only be accessed through previously authorized communication
          channels.
          <br /><br />
          All your information, especially sensitive data, will, whenever
          possible, be encrypted if it does not prevent its use by the platform.
          At any time you may request a copy of your data stored on our systems.
          We will keep the data and information only as long as it is necessary
          or relevant for the purposes described in this Policy, or for periods
          pre-determined by law or until such time as is necessary to maintain
          Weni Flows’s legitimate interests.
          <br /><br />
          Weni considers your privacy to be extremely important and will do
          everything in its power to protect it. However, we cannot guarantee
          completely that all data and information about you on our platform
          will be free from unauthorized access, especially if there is an undue
          sharing of the credentials necessary to access our application.
          Therefore, you are solely responsible for keeping your access password
          in a safe place and it is forbidden to share it with third parties.
          You agree to notify Weni Flows immediately, through secure means, of
          any unauthorized use of your account, as well as unauthorized access
          by third parties to it.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>5. DATA OF YOUR CUSTOMER</b><br />
          Weni Flows is a platform that allows you to collect data and
          information from your customers through messaging services. Weni Flows
          only stores this information on its servers to ensure data protection.
          <br /><br />
          Any and all information collected from your client will depart from
          commands and from your actions. You are solely responsible for
          communicating to your customers what data you collect, for what
          purpose and where they are stored.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>6. PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</b><br />
          Weni reserves the right to change this Policy as many times as
          necessary, in order to provide you with more security, convenience,
          and improve your experience more and more. That is why it is very
          important to access our Policy periodically. To facilitate, we
          indicate in the beginning of the document the date of the last update.
          If any relevant changes are made that need a new authorization from
          you, we will post a new privacy policy.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>7. APPLICABLE LAW</b><br />
          This document is governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance
          with the laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The Forum of the

          <b>Cookie Policy for Weni Flows</b><br />
          This is the Cookie Policy for Weni Flows, accessible from
          https://new.push.al
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>What Are Cookies</b><br />
          Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer to
          improve your experience while visiting certain websites. In here you
          will find information on what they gather for this specific website,
          how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We
          will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored.
          This may, however, downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's
          functionality.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>How We Use Cookies</b><br />
          We use cookies for the reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most
          cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies
          without completely disabling the functionality and features they add
          to a website. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you
          are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to
          provide a service that you use.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>Disabling Cookies</b><br />
          You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on
          your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that
          disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other
          websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also
          disabling certain functionality and features of the this site.
          Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b>The Cookies We Set</b><br />
          Cookies related to account and authentication:

          <ul :style="{ marginBottom: 0 }">
            <li>
              When you create an account with us, cookies will manage the signup
              process. These cookies are usually deleted when you log out -
              however, in some cases, they may remain afterwards to remember
              your site preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use cookies so the website can remember you are logged in. This
              prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit our
              page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log
              out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and
              areas when logged in.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <b>Third Party Cookies</b><br />
          In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third
          parties. The following section details which third party cookies you
          might encounter through this site.
          <ul :style="{ marginBottom: 0 }">
            <li>
              From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to
              the way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new
              features these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a
              consistent experience whilst on the site. This helps us to
              understand which optimisations our users appreciate the most.
